# Clothing Procurement Report

This project is a **Python tool** that generates procurement reports for clothing SKUs.  
It calculates **landed cost, tariffs, freight, and SLA (lead time + shipping)**, then exports an Excel file with three sheets:

- **KPI_Summary** â†’ Total spend, average SLA, SKU count  
- **Best_By_SKU** â†’ Best supplier per SKU (lowest landed cost & SLA)  
- **Supplier_Compare** â†’ Top 5 suppliers per SKU for comparison
